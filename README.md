# To Do List

https://jamesriall.co.uk/react-to-do-list/

## The Project

Built with React, my to do list allows users to view both outstanding to dos as well as completed to dos, shown in separate lists. To dos can be created, deleted, as well as moved between completed and uncompleted lists. They can  be sorted alphabetically or chronologically (ascending or descending), and the user also has the ability to hide or show the completed to do list at his or her preference. Finally, users can change the colour of the app to a selection of four schemes.
